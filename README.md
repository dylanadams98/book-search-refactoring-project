# MERN: Book Search Engine

This is a refactoring application with the purpose of converting a book search engine that uses RESTful API to use GraphQL instead. It involved rebuilding middleware, resolvers and schemas, and ensuring all routes are functioning.

The application is ran with the following command

" npm run develop "

The deployed code is accessible here: https://github.com/dylanadams98/book-search-refactoring-project

The deployed page is currently inaccessible, due to me being locked out of my authenticator for Heroku.
